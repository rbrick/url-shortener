# Yet Another URL shortener
This is a WIP url shortener written in Go. I am trying to make the code clean, and organize (Don't think I am doing to well on that).

## Planned Features
- [ ] Custom URL endings (Supported in the code, just need to implement the logic)
- [ ] Admin panel (View all created links, delete links)
- [ ] User accounts (Allow for users to create accounts and delete their own links, as well as add API keys for them)


## Why use this?
Truthfully, there is no reason to use this. There are a lot of URL shorteners out there that are better than this. This project
is mainly for me to learn, and to try to write clean(er/ish) code, as well as maintain a project, and implement features I have
always wanted to have on my website.

## Security
Probably very shitty.
