# This is the configuration file for the url shortener service.
# A few notes:
# - The redis host should be a host-port string (See https://golang.org/pkg/net/#SplitHostPort)
#     the host & port should both be specified
# - The server port should be between the range of 0-65535 (The range of the ports, AKA limit of a 
#     unsigned 16 bit integer)

    host: 'localhost'
    port: 6379
